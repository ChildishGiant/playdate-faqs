## Multiplayer?

[![At some point! Our first slate of games, no one proposed a multiplayer game, so we punted that](assets/imgs/multiplayer.png)](https://discord.com/channels/675983554655551509/821661913393004565/852558326113108029)
[![So, you couldnâ€™t really write your own networking APIs right nowâ€”you donâ€™t have low-level access like that through our SDK. (If you completely hack the whole thing to run your firmware, then sure.) Weâ€™ll have networking APIs available at some point. For now, weâ€™re focusing on things our season 1 games need.](assets/imgs/multiplayer_2.png)](https://discord.com/channels/675983554655551509/675983555209330691/814165105179885569)
[![We donâ€™t have any networking APIs right now; eventually, yes, but as none of the season 1 games required it, it wasnâ€™t a launch priority](assets/imgs/multiplayer_1.png)](https://discord.com/channels/675983554655551509/675983555209330691/852164678414368808)

## How big are games?
[![In my experience, regardless of their size and even their art, most Playdate games are like 500 KB. Then you add music and they're 50 MB+ ðŸ˜‚ So yeah, don't worry about a few megs](assets/imgs/size.png)](https://discord.com/channels/675983554655551509/675983555209330691/821480814562771044)
[![we do see a lot of variety. Some games are like 220 KB WITH Music, if they go the synth route rather than wave files.](assets/imgs/size_1.png)](https://discord.com/channels/675983554655551509/675983555209330691/821502848793575455)
## When will the SDK be released
[![I can confirm that the SDK release is independent of the hardware release. If one is ready first, we won't hold it back. (Which one will be ready first? Can't really sayâ€¦)](assets/imgs/release.png)](https://discord.com/channels/675983554655551509/675983555209330691/756225570463023344)

## Are there haptics (vibration motor)?

[![Yeah wouldâ€™ve been cool, but we just ran out of space. For what itâ€™s worth, audio can sort of kind of fool you into thinking thereâ€™s haptic](assets/imgs/vibration.png)](https://discord.com/channels/675983554655551509/675983555209330691/852588044335054899)

## How durable is the crank?

[![For reference, Iâ€™ve had my Playdate unit for about two years. The crank is as good as new ðŸ™‚](assets/imgs/crank_1.png)](https://discord.com/channels/675983554655551509/675983555209330691/793153885513711696)
[![My Playdate is about 3 years old and I havenâ€™t noticed any issues. Everything wears out eventually, but Iâ€™m confident about the crank](assets/imgs/crank_2.png)](https://discord.com/channels/675983554655551509/675983555209330691/852588435808976896)
